My exciting pieces of work on Reinforcement Learning.


**Reinforcement learning** is kind of machine learning technique that an agent for interacting with the environment is trained through getting states and rewards from the environment and then taking actions in order to achieve a better reward.
For model the environment, Markov Decision Process (MDP) is used.
